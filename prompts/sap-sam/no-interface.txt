Above is a BPMN 2.0 choreography. Generate a solidity smart contract from this.
Name the contract by the choreography ID.
The contract must let participants execute their task. Only tasks are executed, gateways are evaluated by the smart contract autonomously.
It enforces the order of tasks.
Outgoing flows from an exclusiveGateway which are not the default flow, need to enforce a condition.
The conditions are present in the model as "conditionExpression". Enforce them based on the flow given in the diagram.
The contract needs a way to set the data of the conditions.

Also, enforce the correct initiator (initiatingParticipantRef) of a task by comparing the address.
Participants' addresses are set in the constructor.

Just output the smart contract, do not output additional, redundant text. In case of 
problems write "ERROR" followed by a precise diagnosis of the problem.
